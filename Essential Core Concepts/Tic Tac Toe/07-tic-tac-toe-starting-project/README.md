# Introdution

- I create a Tic tac toe game (with mock logic for wining combinations). Besides practice ReactJS Core Concepts, I also apply lifting-up-state technique to allow shared state between components.
- In this project, the users can:
  ðŸ‘‰ User can change their displaying name
  ðŸ‘‰ Play tic tac toe with simple 3x3 matrix
  ðŸ‘‰ Track users turns as in Snapshot 4
  ðŸ‘‰ Display a basic notification panel when the game is drawn or there is a winner (as shown in Snapshot 5)
