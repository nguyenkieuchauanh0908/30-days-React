# About ReactJS and this repo:

<p>ðŸ‘‰ React is a widely used library for web and native user interfaces allowing developers to build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components and then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps. </p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ This repo records my 30-day journey with ReactJS (from core concepts like components, hooks, props drilling, ref and portal, working with forms and HTTP requests, etc... to more advanced ones such as Context, Redux, React Router, React Query, JWT Authentication, NextJS) 
It can also be used as a reference for anyone who needs a detailed plan to learn React quickly. </p>

ðŸ‘‰**_Important note:_** This repo is not a ReactJS official doc but only for reference purposes. I highly recommend you visit the latest doc released from the <a href='https://react.dev/'>React official doc</a> and their <a href='https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev'>GitHub repo</a>. Besides, contents that are marked as **Optional** can be skipped if you've been already familiar while ones that are marked as **Extended** are not necessary to study immediately (you can skip them if you don't have time now but you can come back later)

# Content

## Day 1: Javascript, HTML, CSS Refresher (**Optional**)

- Because React is a library built from Javascript, having foundational knowledge in JS is a must. However, you don't need to be an expert in JS to start with React. For those who have been already working around with other languages and get used to the core concepts of programming
  such as variables, loops, functions, modules, etc... You can jump into React quite in just a day or two. For beginners who have no prior programming experience, this can take a bit longer. I highly recommend this <a href='https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript'>30-Days-Of-Javascript</a> (you don't need to follow all of these to start with React).
  You should also know HTML and CSS for styling purposes (These can be taken along the way but prior experience is a benefit)
- Outcome: Make sure you know at least these concepts of JS before jumping into React:
  <div>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰ Global and Local Variables (the difference of var, let, const in terms of scope): </p>
    <p><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let'>Read more about let</a> and <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const'>Read more about const</a></p>
  </div>
   
  <div>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰ Functions in Javascript: </p>
    <p>- Function Declaration</p>
    <p>- Function Expression</p>
    <p>- Arrow Function</p>
    <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions'>Official doc</a> and <a href='https://www.w3schools.in/javascript/types-of-functions'>here</a>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰ Working with an array in JS: Besides basic concepts such as loop, there are built-in methods that you must know</p>
    <p>- map()</p>
    <p>- reduce() </p>
    <p>- filter()</p>
    <p>- find(), findIndex(), findLast(), ...</p>
    <p>- forEach()</p>
    <p>- slice(), spice(), concat()</p>
    <p>- push(), pop(), unshift()</p>

  </div>

   <div>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰ Import and Export module: You would work with components a lot in React so knowing how to import and export is a must</p>
    <p>- Named Import/Export</p>
    <p>- Default Import/Export</p>

  </div>

  <div>
     <p>ðŸ‘‰ Classes: (Optional) You can skip this if you already have a foundation in OOP or are beginners (In fact, not a lot of projects in Reacts use classes after the advent of hooks so you can come back to it later)</p>
